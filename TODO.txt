Normal PMT Counts:
	talk to paul's box and be able to change the duration by reprogramming it
	after hardware is fixed, fix jumps after switching timing
	implement hardware timeout / make sure it doesn't crash if timeout
Client:
	Conver all clients sans experimenter to asynchronuos, redo the GUI
Server:
	spectrum analyzer server, then calibrate VCO
	separate double pass server with signals / one if daring then select
Scripts:
    resolution as a parameter for scripts
    separate resolution for how quickly to come back
    save detunings, other parameters
PMt server:
    transpose data, float_ in the server
Data vault improvement:
    accept int32
TimeResolvedFlow:
    properly add the compressed data / new folder / many traces?
    change name of live fft
    currentdataset() crashes
PMTflow:
    normal pmt starts new datase

report on:
    intensity stabilization
    dark resonances to see estimate linewidth on new laser
    FFT
