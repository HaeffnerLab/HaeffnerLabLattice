# This is an example of a 'profile' file which includes a base file and adds
# some customizaton for a particular purpose.

# If this file is found in the user's ~/.ipython directory as ipythonrc-scipy,
# it can be loaded by calling passing the '-profile scipy' (or '-p scipy')
# option to IPython.

# This example is meant to load several modules to turn ipython into a very
# capable environment for communicating with DMS.

# load our basic configuration with generic options
include ipythonrc

# import ...
# Load the labrad module
import_mod labrad

# from ... import ...
import_some

import_all pylab

# code 
execute print 'Welcome to LabRAD!'
execute print '---------------\n'
execute print 'type "labrad.tutorial()" if you need help getting started'
