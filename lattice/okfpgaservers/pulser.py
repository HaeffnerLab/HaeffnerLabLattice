####
#in software: be able to send a trigger to an arbitrary channel 
#LABRAD: remove all references to local path
#remove unneeded libraries
#set inversions with the hardware, standardize inversion
#update switches in the beginning
#listeners
#set pmt counting initially to 100ms
#check higher channels numbers >9
#from struct import Struct
#changing inversion requires restatr -> save setting
#give long pmt counting a try
