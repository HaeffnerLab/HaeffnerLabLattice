Fitting Carrier rabi flops to extract pi times:

info = ('Carrier Flops', ('2013Nov22','1600_31'))
ion0: 6.02 mus
ion1: 5.35 mus

info = ('Carrier Flops', ('2013Nov22','1523_22'))
nbar = 6 pm 0.5
detuning=0.07 doesn't matter as different ion

Delay scan 7.5 mus
1616_58, 1634_58 0 - 500 mus, have to remove a point, lowest excitation 0.155 pm pm 0.01 stat
blind analysis yilds that minimum excitation should be ~0.2
problem: axial mode is hot -> wrong rabi time -> wrong sideband flop
