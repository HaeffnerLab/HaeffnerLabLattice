''' unwrap.py -- a function that makes every paragraph in a text into a single long line
                  so that the text will look right in a "word wrapping" environment 
                  (e.g. a word processor, HTML text box or a Palm Doc document).

    A paragraph is:
        1. an indented line followed by one or more unidented lines;
        2. two or more unidented lines with a blank line above.

    An indented line contains text and has leading spaces.
    An unindented line contains text but has no leading spaces.
    A blank line may contain spaces but not text; it may also be the start of the text.

    Anything other than those two types of paragraph (e.g. blocks of
    fully indented text, single lines) will be left alone.
